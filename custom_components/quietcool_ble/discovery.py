"""QuietCool Bluetooth advertisement matching helpers.

Most controllers advertise a BLE local name beginning with ``ATTICFAN``. Some
revisions omit the name entirely and instead broadcast the manufacturer-specific
signature ``3atticfan`` (company ID 0x6133, payload prefix ``tticfan``); BlueZ
then surfaces only the MAC address. These helpers recognise both variants and
produce a sensible display name when only the address is available.

Credit: the manufacturer-data variant was reverse-engineered by
[@viss](https://github.com/viss/ha-quietcool-ble).
